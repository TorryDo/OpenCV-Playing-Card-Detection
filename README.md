# Playing Card Detection

The user simply puts the card on a flat surface, and the program will 
- threshold the image
- find the card
- isolate the corners
- split it into rank and suit
- compare with the stored rank/suit images and then return the result

It can identify as many cards as can fit on a frame, and different sets of decks can be used too

### Used Packages
- `Python 3.11.5` (newer versions may or may not work)
- `opencv`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
